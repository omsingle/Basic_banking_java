# Basic_banking_java
This is an basic project of banking that i have build using java concepts- if-else, Switch case, Constructer fields and getters and setters.
In this project you can see that how atms works like deposting money, withdrawing money, transfer money and logout.
And i have used a OTP system by using MATH library of java, by generating a random no. and converting that number in integer.
